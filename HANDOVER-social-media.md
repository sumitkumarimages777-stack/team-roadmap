# Social Media space: handover notes

Give this file to Claude at the start of a new chat. Say: "Read HANDOVER-social-media.md, then help me with …".

## What it is

The **Social Media** space on tools.dubuddy.in, for the DU Buddy team. Its numbers fill in by themselves from YouTube and Instagram every morning at 8:00 AM IST. Anyone in the team can also press **Sync now**, at most once every 10 minutes.

It has five tabs:

- **🎯 Targets:** weekly and monthly targets for each platform, plus posting times. Only people whose role has **Edit social targets** can change them. An owner ticks that permission under Administration → Roles & permissions.
- **📊 Summary:** everything below is on this tab.
  - The **Both / YouTube only / Instagram only** switch, and **Compare Instagram vs YouTube**.
  - Target cards showing value / target.
  - **Which posts brought followers/subscribers.**
  - **Process health** boxes. Click one to see its details.
  - Keyword performance.
  - Follower and subscriber growth.
  - **Where your audience is:** states, then cities, plus metros vs other cities vs towns & rural.
  - **Published posts:** filters like Zoho, saved views, CSV export, and bulk tagging (for example Creator = Sivam).
- **💡 Ideation, 🎬 Content Process, 🗓 Schedule:** the team's own template, uploaded as Dubuddy_Social_Media_Space.html.

Wording: YouTube says **subscribers** and Instagram says **followers**.

## Where things live

| Part | Where |
|---|---|
| Website code | GitHub repo `sumitkumarimages777-stack/team-roadmap`, branch `main`. `index.html` is the app; `social-space.js` is the Social Media space. |
| Database | Supabase project `bzhnzrmnbphkcasvrsnc`. Tables `social_posts`, `social_snapshots`, `social_geo`, `social_post_daily`, `social_sync_config`. Set-up files are in `supabase/` (stage7a, stage8a, stage9a, all already applied). |
| Sync program | Supabase Edge Function `sync-social`, with "Verify JWT" OFF because it checks callers itself. Its code is in `supabase/functions/sync-social/index.ts`. Always deploy the **whole file**. |
| Daily timer | Supabase cron job `sync-social-daily` (02:30 UTC). |
| Keys | Supabase → Edge Functions → Secrets: `YT_CLIENT_ID`, `YT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YT_REFRESH_TOKEN` (Google), `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN` (a Meta system-user token that never expires, from the "Dubuddy Socials Sync" app in the DU Buddy business portfolio). **Never paste keys into a chat.** |

## What the platforms do NOT give, so don't chase it

- **Followers per Instagram Reel:** Meta's API refuses "follows" for Reels. The posts table has a box where you can type the number from the Instagram app. The team chose not to use an automatic estimate. Some backend code for one, `attributeFollows`, still runs but nothing shows it.
- **YouTube thumbnail CTR / impressions:** not available through the API. They're only in YouTube Studio.
- **Districts:** neither platform gives them. Cities are the closest.
- **Urban / rural:** neither platform gives it. The chart shows metros vs other top cities vs "towns & rural", where towns & rural means everything outside the top cities.
- **YouTube subscribers by state or city:** YouTube gives them by country only. Viewers come by city, and the sync maps each city to its state with a built-in list.
- **Instagram locations:** top 45 cities only.
- **Webinars, community posts, stories and Instagram lives:** not tracked by any API. Type them in by hand on the Summary target cards.

## How changes get made

1. Claude works on a branch, tests it in a browser, then opens a pull request and merges it to `main`. The website updates from `main`.
2. Database changes go in a new `supabase/stageNx_….sql` file, and Claude applies them through the Supabase connection.
3. After changing `sync-social`, deploy the whole file and then press **Sync now** to check it works.

## If numbers look wrong

1. Press **Sync now** on the Summary, wait a minute and refresh.
2. If a platform's numbers are missing, ask Claude to read `social_sync_config.last_result`. It holds the last sync's messages for YouTube, Instagram and places.
3. If the result says "Google sign-in failed", the Google refresh token was revoked. Make a new one in the OAuth Playground and replace `YT_REFRESH_TOKEN` in Supabase Secrets.
4. If it's an Instagram token error, generate a new system-user token in Meta Business settings → System users, and replace `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## Clean-up you can do any time

- In Supabase → Edge Functions, delete the old `ig-debug` function. It's already switched off.
